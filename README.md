# QSEM-Viewer
(better name needs to be thought up)

Work in progress...

This is going to be universal graphical program for openning and exploring the SEM projects (At least Bruker Esprit ~~and Jeol Analytic Station formats~~[that is not any more for me relevant]) and files (single spectra from Bruker, mappings, Cameca Peaksight files) with some datetime tracking functionality

Dependencies:
`PyQt5`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pyqtgraph` (at least 0.11.0rc), `periodictable` 

WIP. Major redesign.
